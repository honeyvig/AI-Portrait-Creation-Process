# AI-Portrait-Creation-Process
To help streamline your portrait creation process and leverage AI for automation, here's how you can break down and approach the solution step-by-step. The process you outlined can benefit significantly from automation through machine learning models, face recognition algorithms, and image generation tools. Below is a proposed solution with Python code examples for key stages.
Key Stages for AI Portrait Creation Process:

    Upload and Face Detection: Use deep learning models to identify faces from customer-uploaded photos.
    Face Grouping and Identification: Automatically group faces and ask the customer to confirm which faces to keep or exclude.
    Customer Instruction Input: Allow customers to provide specific instructions about the portrait style, color, etc.
    Style Selection and Image Enhancement: Use a neural network model to enhance and apply the selected style.
    Create Custom Portrait: Leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) or pre-trained models to generate portraits based on the provided instructions.
    Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop where customers can provide feedback directly on the portrait, which is used to further refine the image.
    Final Proof and Delivery: Once the portrait is finalized, provide the customer with a downloadable version.

1. Upload Photos and Face Detection (Using OpenCV and dlib)

For the face detection part, you can use libraries like OpenCV and dlib to automatically detect and group faces from the uploaded images.

pip install opencv-python dlib

Hereâ€™s a sample Python code to detect and identify faces in an uploaded image:

import cv2
import dlib
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load pre-trained face detector
detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()

# Load an image
img = cv2.imread('path_to_uploaded_image.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Detect faces in the image
faces = detector(gray)

# Draw rectangles around detected faces
for i, face in enumerate(faces):
    x, y, w, h = (face.left(), face.top(), face.width(), face.height())
    cv2.rectangle(img, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)

# Show the image with detected faces
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.show()

This code detects faces in an image and highlights them. The next step involves grouping these faces and asking customers to confirm or exclude them.
2. Face Grouping (Using Face Recognition)

You can use Face Recognition for identifying whether multiple images of the same person appear in the uploaded photos.

pip install face_recognition

Here's how to identify and group faces:

import face_recognition

# Load the image
img = face_recognition.load_image_file("path_to_uploaded_image.jpg")

# Find all face locations and encodings
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(img)
face_encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(img, face_locations)

# Group faces (Here, for simplicity, just show detected faces)
for i, face_location in enumerate(face_locations):
    top, right, bottom, left = face_location
    print(f"Face {i+1} found at pixel location: Top: {top}, Left: {left}, Bottom: {bottom}, Right: {right}")

Once faces are detected, you can ask customers to confirm or exclude faces based on the bounding boxes shown.
